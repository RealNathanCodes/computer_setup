For setting up a new Windows machine, download the files in this directory and tweak the install/upgrade docs to include only the items you want on the machine.

Run the Choco setup and post choco setup files to get setup, after that, whenever you want to update, run the choco upgrade file.
I like to let browsers and vs code update themselves after they install, so I tend not to include self updating items in the upgrade file.
